      <h3 className="content_subheader">Breast Augmentation and Reasons for Preference</h3>
      <p className="content_text">
        Breast augmentation is among the popular operations in aesthetic surgery. The reasons for choosing such an operation can generally be based on physical, emotional, and psychological factors. Breast augmentation surgery can be chosen to increase women's self-confidence, maintain body proportions, or restore lost breast tissue after certain medical conditions.
        <br /><br />
        Genetic factors, age, weight loss, breastfeeding, or hormonal changes can lead to unwanted changes in the breasts. This situation can negatively affect the self-confidence of many women. Breast augmentation provides an opportunity for women to achieve the desired breast size and shape after these situations.
        <br /><br />
        Furthermore, some women may believe that having small breasts in proportion to their bodies disrupts their overall body proportions. Breast augmentation is a treatment method that can be preferred to achieve a more harmonious and balanced appearance.
        <br /><br />
        Certain health issues, especially surgical interventions like mastectomy, can result in partial or complete loss of breast tissue. After such situations, breast augmentation surgery can be chosen by women to regain their psychological and physical integrity.
